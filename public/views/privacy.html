    I collect some anonymous information on the activity of the site's visitors. The purpose is mainly to see if there is any way to improve the
    site experience. I do not collect any personal identifiable information nor do I sell any information I gather to any third parties. Some
    sections of the site allow you to submit information (e.g. signing up or creating a League on <a href="/MLF">My LoL Fantasy</a>). This information
    is stored by the service in order to provide certain site functionality. You are welcome to use pseudonymous information in order to protect
    your identity.

  <h1 class="content-heading">Cookies</h1>
  <p>
    This site makes use of cookies to do a few things. One: I use Google Analytics to get an idea of the site's traffic. Two: certain sections of the site
    (<a href="/MLF">My LoL Fantasy</a> for instance) make use of a session identifier to keep track of session-based information on visitors, such as whether
    a user is logged in. That's pretty much it! Nothing too out of the ordinary.
